### London Bike shares forecasting
[Bike shares](https://github.com/Erik-02/Bike-shares)
This project is a time series forecasting project using the London bike sharing dataset. The data contains the number of bikes shared for each hour from 2015-2017. 
This project is a complete forecasting repertoire including Baseline, Statistical, Machine learning and Deep learning forecasts. The forecasts are very accurate, allowing the business to have insights into the total demand required. This increases business profit since they can accurately have the total number of products available. This project includes Data analysis and visualization in an interactive manner through a Streamlit app and can be accessed using the following link(https://bike-shares.streamlit.app/DL)

### Time Series Analysis & Prediction 

[NYC Uber predictions](https://github.com/Erik-02/TSA-NYC-Uber)
This dataset contained all of the Uber pickups in NYC during 2014 and 2015. The data includes the pickup location and the time of the pickup.
With this information I was able to produce visual heatmaps showing the locations of the pickups and patterns for each hour of the day.
I was also able to predict the number of pickups for each location during any hour of the day with an accuracy of up to 95% which allowed the business to allocate drivers much more effectively and thus save money.

### Image Classification
[Face emotion classification with Gradio UI](https://github.com/Erik-02/face_classification)
<br>
This project is an Image classification model that uses a CNN model to classify images of humans according to their expressions such as Happy, Neutral and Sad.
By using Python and Keras I created my own CNN model that is able to classify the images.
The model achieved a high accuracy and performed 2% better than what other individuals could have achieved.
I also integrated Gradio to create a simple UI where users can input an image, and receive the classification along with the accuracy score as the output.
