### Time Series Analysis & Prediction 

[NYC Uber predictions](https://github.com/Erik-02/TSA-NYC-Uber)
This dataset contained all of the Uber pickups in NYC during 2014 and 2015. The data includes the pickup location and the time of the pickup.
With this information I was able to produce visual heatmaps showing the locations of the pickups and patterns for each hour of the day.
I was also able to predict the number of pickups for each location during any hour of the day with an accuracy of up to 95% which allowed the business to allocate drivers much more effectively and thus save money.

### Image Classification
[Face emotion classification with Gradio UI](https://github.com/Erik-02/face_classification)
<br>
This project is an Image classification model that uses a CNN model to classify images of humans according to their expressions such as Happy, Neutral and Sad.
By using Python and Keras I created my own CNN model that is able to classify the images.
The model achieved a high accuracy and performed 2% better than what other individuals could have achieved.
I also integrated Gradio to create a simple UI where users can input an image, and receive the classification along with the accuracy score as the output.
