### Image Classification

<br>
This project is an Image classification model that uses a CNN model to classify images of humans according to their expressions such as Happy, Neutral and Sad.
By using Python and Keras I created my own CNN model that is able to classify the images.
The model achieved a high accuracy and performed 2% better than what other individuals could have achieved.
I also integrated Gradio to create a simple UI where users can input an image, and receive the classification along with the accuracy score as the output.
